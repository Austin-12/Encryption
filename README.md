# Encryption

This project will be a two step project were I build a encryption app that will encrypt a 4 digit integer. After I will make an decryption app that will decrypt that 4 digit integer back into the original integer

**Enforcing Privacy with Cryptography Project**

This project will be a two step project were I build a encryption app that will encrypt a 4 digit integer. After I will
make an decryption app that will decrypt that 4 digit integer back into the original integer. I completed this after reading chapter 5
of my visual c# book about algorithm development and control statements.

How it works:
The application works simple you run and you put in a 4 digit integer and it displays the encrypted code.

What I learned:
This was my first time using the tryParse method I can see this being very useful in the future
for checking for correct input. I used this to add some error cases make sure the input was the correct length and correct type.
I also never thought about extracting the individual values of an integer as well so that is something else that I learned doing this project.
